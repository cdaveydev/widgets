# Contributing to Dashboard Widgets

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Dashboard Widgets as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Submit a pull request

### Issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!

### Feature Requests

We also use GitHub issues for feature requests. We appreciate detailed descriptions that:

- Explain the problem you're trying to solve
- Outline the solution you'd like to see
- Describe alternatives you've considered

## Styling Guidelines

This project uses:

- TypeScript for static type checking
- React functional components with hooks
- CSS variables for theming

Please follow the existing coding style and patterns when contributing.

## Widget Development Guidelines

When creating or modifying widgets:

1. Each widget should be a self-contained component
2. Use the existing component structure as a template
3. Widgets should properly handle all four size modes (small, medium, large, x-large)
4. Simulate data changes with appropriate intervals
5. Ensure responsive design for all device sizes
